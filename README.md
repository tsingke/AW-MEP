## 🚀 Project Overview  
Symbolic regression focuses on discovering **interpretable mathematical expressions** to model complex nonlinear relationships in data. Traditional Multi-Expression Programming (MEP) is elegant, yet often limited by premature convergence, fixed operator schemes, and sub-optimal exploration–exploitation balance. To overcome these limitations, we introduce **Adaptive Weighted Multi-Expression Programming (AW-MEP)** — a novel framework that integrates multiple self-regulating mechanisms for dynamic control of evolution. AW-MEP is designed to deliver improved convergence, higher generalization, and enhanced search efficiency for real-world symbolic modeling tasks.  

## 🔍 Key Innovations  
1. **Dynamic Operator Weighting Strategy**: Continuously assesses and updates the importance of genetic operators based on contribution feedback, guiding search direction and eliminating redundant operations.  
2. **Entropy-Guided Adaptive Mutation Rate**: Maintains population diversity and avoids stagnation by self-adjusting mutation intensity in response to entropy feedback.  
3. **Weighted Crossover + Elitist Preservation**: A refined genetic manipulation scheme combining weighted recombination and elitist retention to accelerate convergence without losing diversity.  
4. **Volcanic Simulated Annealing (VSA)**: Periodic energy-based perturbation enables the population to escape local optima and improves global search capability.  

## 📊 Experimental Highlights  
> Extensive experiments on 12 benchmarks (6 real-world regression datasets such as Boston Housing, California Housing, Diabetes, Red Wine Quality, Airfoil Self-Noise, Concrete Compressive Strength; along with 6 symbolic regression functions) demonstrate that AW-MEP consistently outperforms classical MEP, Gene Expression Programming (GEP), and standard symbolic regression (SR) methods.  
> Quantitative gains: Mean Squared Error (MSE) reduction of **7%–47%**, up to **30% faster convergence**, and lower computational cost.
